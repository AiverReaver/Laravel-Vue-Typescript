# Laravel-Vue-Typescript
This quick start guide will teach you how to get Laravel TypeScript and Vue working together. This guide is flexible enough that any steps here can be used to integrate TypeScript into an existing Laravel project. Sepecfically Laravel 5.7 .

Laravel 5.7 uses Laravel-mix which down the line uses webpack 3 . Which is not what we want for typescript to work in laravel project.
